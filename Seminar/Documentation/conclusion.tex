The DROPS methodology is a cloud storage security scheme that jointly deals with the security and performance in terms of retrieval time. The data file was fragmented and the fragments are scattered over multiple nodes. The nodes were separated by means of T-coloring. The fragmentation and dispersal make sure that no significant information was obtainable by an antagonist in case of a successful attack. No node in the cloud, stored more than a single fragment of the same file.

\paragraph{}
The scope of this work is divide a file into fragments, and replicate the fragmented data over the cloud nodes. Each of the nodes stores only a single fragment of a particular data file that ensures that even in case of a successful attack, no meaningful information is revealed to the attacker.
