\par Internet of Things (IoT) plays an important role in
the development of various fields. The increasing scale and
scope of applications make a great demand of IoT data
exchange in recent years. Meanwhile, a number of IoT data
exchange platforms which dedicated to connecting various and
distributed data sources are emerging. In such a platform,
service providers can search and exchange the data sets that
they need. However, the centralized infrastructure cannot
provide enough trust as the third-party intermediaries for data exchange. As a result, most platforms unable to satisfy the complex requirements due to few institutions and individuals are willing to share their IoT data sets in such an
untrustworthy environment. This paper proposes a
decentralized solution based on the blockchain for IoT data
trusted exchange. Specifically, In this paper, the basic
principles of blockchain and corresponding key technologies
are expounded through in-depth analysis of three main reliable
requirements in IoT data exchange. Besides, this paper
provides an architecture of above solution and detailed design
of its main trust component. Finally, it realizes a prototype by
using Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts and presents
its auditable, transparent, decentralized features visually.
